    <string name="screen1">Viola finds herself in the middle of a forest. Looking around she sees a small
    cat sitting on a tree stump. A rotten log sits to her left, full of bugs and moss.\n\n
    \"Hello,\" the cat says. \"You\'re up and at \'em eh?\"\n\n
    Viola searches her pockets and finds a letter. It reads:\n\n
    \"I don\'t mind if you go to her house, but just stay away from the forest. Hope to see you home soon. \n-Dad\"\n\n
    Viola walks over to the sign post in the middle of the grove. One sign points to the north with the
    description: \".....\'s House\". The other sign points south with the description: \"Out of the Forest\".\n\n</string>
